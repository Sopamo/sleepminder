# SleepMinder
A sleep monitoring application for Android. Includes a framework to create custom sleep monitoring apps. This application is a demonstration of the library's features.

This framework and the demo application were developed during my bachelor thesis at the Univeritiy of Ulm:

*Disclaimer: This application has been written in 2014 and the android code might be quite outdated now. However, the bachelor thesis still provides some interesting insight into sleep monitoring.*
